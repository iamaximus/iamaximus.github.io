## Permutation
A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a definite order. The members or elements of sets are arranged here in a sequence or linear order. For example, the permutation of set A={1,6} is 2, such as {1,6}, {6,1}. As you can see, there are no other ways to arrange the elements of set A.

In permutation, the elements should be arranged in a particular order whereas in combination the order of elements does not matter.
